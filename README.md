# Graph-Mining

### Learning Objectives

The goal of this project is exploring the PageRank algorithm on big real-world network data. By working on this project, I learnt how to implement the PageRank algorithms that we have learned in the class.

### Dataset

'Google-web.txt' is the data that each line of the file represents a directed edge from one node to the other. Nodes are represented by ID ranging from 0 to 875712.

### Tasks

This project includes implementing the power iteration in matrix form without considering the dead-ends and spider traps, extending the code to handle spider traps and dead-ends, and implementing the biased PageRank algorithm.
